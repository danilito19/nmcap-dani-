Made contact with Mr. Joseph Sanchez, Procurement/Purchasing Agent in October 2012 to start getting quotes with outside vendors.
November 2012 Mr. Sanchez sent me an email to let me know he was looking for quotes and found three places.
January 2013 discussed with Mr. Sanchez as to what avenues he took with the vendor he found that we are going to purchase the Handicap Van w/lift.
January 8, 2013 met with Mr. Sanchez as to when we will be able to go after the Handicap Van.
March 11, 2013 met with Tribal Official, Mr. Sanchez to go over details of the handicap van.
March 19, 2013 met with Accounting/Procurement staff to discuss the purchase of the Handicap Van w/lift we were offered by the vendor regarding price, warranty, vin number, etc.
April 16, 2013 the vendor decided to sell the Handicap Van to another company.
During this process it has been a difficult task but we are doing our best to find other avenues to conquer, we have been calling/visiting dealerships for quotes/bids. I went to our Tribal Administration to see if they could help us with additional funds and have also tried at the State level to see if they could match funds.  Due to budget cuts everyone seem to be short on funds.  We will continue to move forward to search and hoping that someone will be able to meet our needs.

7/17/2013 - Update on this report for the June 30, 2013.  As of this time the Pueblo of Acoma CHR Program has submitted a Special Project Fund through the Indian Affairs Department to help supplement the FY 2012 Severance Tax Bond Project we currently have. We are proud to announce that we received funding for this Special Project in the amount of the  35,000 and which will be utilized towards the current FY 2012 Project.  We will continue to search and meet finally our needs for the Handicap Van which is much needed for the community.
